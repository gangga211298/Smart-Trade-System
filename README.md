# Smart Trade System

## Background
Astrido Toyota Kebon Jeruk achieved only **9%** of its **10% trade-in sales target**. Internal evaluations highlighted two main challenges:
- Salespeople lacked organization in the trade-in process, with each relying on their own methods and external partners.
- No digital tools were available to monitor database utilization and trade-in activities, resulting in suboptimal prospect management.

To overcome these issues, the **Smart-Trade System** was developed as an integrated digital platform.  
The system consolidates database utilization, enables real-time monitoring of sales activities, and provides transparency in managing both trade-in prospects and new car sales.  
With Smart-Trade, every opportunity can be tracked and followed up more effectively, supporting the achievement of trade-in targets and improving overall sales performance.

## Objectives
- Provide an **integrated digital platform** that enables salespeople to easily access, update, and manage prospects.
- **Monitor database utilization in real time**, ensuring every stage from follow-up to deal closing is clearly tracked.
- Enhance **transparency and accountability** at both the individual and team levels.
- Support the achievement of **trade-in and new car sales targets** by ensuring every prospect is followed up effectively and efficiently.

## Tools & Technology
- **AppSheet** â†’ Main application for data cleansing, follow-up activities, and customer prospecting.
- **Google Sheets** â†’ Centralized database for storing all input from the sales team.
- **Looker Studio** â†’ Interactive monitoring dashboards for reporting and supporting the PDCA cycle.

## Flow of Use
The Smart-Trade System involves the sales team at Astrido Toyota Kebon Jeruk, including **Salesmen, Sales Supervisors (SPV), and Branch Managers (BM).**

### Flow Process:
1. **Lead Generation**  
   - Data sourced from Astrido Toyota Kebon Jeruk sales.  
   - Combined with non-Astrido Toyota sales data from vehicles serviced at Astrido Toyota Kebon Jeruk.  

2. **Lead Distribution**  
   - Data distributed to salespeople according to their focus on specific vehicle models and types.  

3. **Data Cleansing**  
   - Salespeople classify the database into **Active** and **Passive**.  

4. **Passive Database Handling**  
   - If number inactive â†’ process ends.  
   - If the car has been sold â†’ transferred as leads for **GR & BP service** (if customer owns another car).  

5. **Active Database Handling (Prospecting)**  
   - Active customers proceed to prospecting.  
   - Results categorized into **Hot, Medium, Low prospects**.  

6. **Prospect Categorization**  
   - **Low** â†’ directed as leads for GR & BP service.  
   - **Medium** â†’ remains as trade-in leads but requires further approach.  
   - **Hot** â†’ immediately processed as priority trade-in candidates.  

7. **Closing & PDCA**  
   - **SPK** â†’ process completed (closing).  
   - **Pending** â†’ evaluation & PDCA required.  
   - **Lost** â†’ evaluation & PDCA required.

## Monitoring & Dashboard
The entire Smart-Trade System workflow is fully integrated and can be monitored in **real-time** through an **interactive dashboard**.  
This dashboard presents key insights such as:  
- Database cleansing status  
- Prospect distribution (**Hot, Medium, Low**)  
- Follow-up activities  
- Closing results  

With this visibility, **Management, Supervisors, and Sales** are empowered to make faster, more accurate, and data-driven decisions to maximize both trade-in and new car sales potential.

## Results & Insights
The implementation of the **Smart-Trade System** has successfully streamlined database distribution, prospecting, and monitoring processes that were previously managed manually using Excel.

With this system:
- Salespeople can easily perform cleansing, prospecting, and follow-ups directly through the application.  
- Supervisors can monitor the progress of each salesperson in real-time, identify obstacles, and execute **PDCA** more effectively.  
- Branch Managers have access to an interactive dashboard that displays:  
  - Database cleansing status (**Active vs. Inactive**)  
  - Prospect distribution (**Hot, Medium, Low**)  
  - Follow-up & customer engagement activities  
  - Conversion rates to closing status (**SPK, Pending, Lost**)  
  - **PDCA summary** for pending & lost customers
